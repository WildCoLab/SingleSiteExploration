# Single Site Exploration and data export
R code to explore the data from WildCo standardised data - not to run this script on data exported from Wild # you will first need to run the standardiser script (Mitch?).

This script allows you to:

## Plot your camera locations

## See when cameras were active

## Summarise species detections and labels

## Explore detections through time and space

## Subset to "independent" data based a threshold you provide

## Output analysis ready matrices of detections at total, monthly and weekly tiemscales
